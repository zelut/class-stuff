<body>
This is an example <b>HTML</b> email. This will have all kinds of pretty
formatting, but as you can see will take up more space and requires a
bit more attention to detail.
<br />

We could also include links to images, world-retrievable .css styling
and other design characteristics in this email if we wanted.
<br />

For now we'll just keep it somewhat <i>simple</i>.
