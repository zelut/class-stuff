This is a test of the emergency broadcast system. This is only a test.

BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE...EEEEP!

This is a test of the emergency broadcast system. The broadcasters of
your area, in voluntary cooperation with Federal, State, and Local
authorities, have developed this system to keep you informed in the
event of an emergency. If this had been an actual emergency, the
attention signal you just heard would have been followed by news and
instructions. This system serves the ((city/county)) area. This
concludes this test of the emergency broadcast system.
